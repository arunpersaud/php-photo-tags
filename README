This are some simple php files and bash scripts to display your F-spot
photos including information from the data-base on a webpage.

You can exclude/include certain tags incase you want for example on
show pictures on the web that were tagged "Public".

To use the scripts copy config.ini_template to config.ini, edit it and
then run for example

f-spot-db-reduce.sh --include='Public'

This will create a new smaller database that only contains information
about pictures with the Public tag.  Next run

./create_thumbnails.sh

This script creates thumbnails of all pictures and save them in local
directories. I will only create 100 pictures though, so you will need
to run it several times. This is done, so that you can easily run it
via cron for example every hour on a remote server without creating
jobs that last forever.

Ones this is done you can visit index.php and everything should be working.

Feel free to fork, send in patches, make suggestions.
