This are some simple php files and bash scripts to display your F-spot
photos including information from the data-base on a webpage. To get
up and running follow these steps:

1) You can exclude/include certain tags incase you want for example on
show pictures on the web that were tagged "Public".

To use the scripts copy config.ini_template to config.ini, edit it and
then run for example

f-spot-db-reduce.sh --include='Public'

This will create a new smaller database that only contains information
about pictures with the Public tag.

2)  Next run

./create_thumbnails.sh

This script creates thumbnails of all pictures and save them in local
directories. I will only create 50 pictures at a time though, so you
will need to run it several times. This is done, so that you limit the
time this tasks run, so that it doesn't get shut down on for example
rented web-space where execcive CPU uses is an issue.

3) install .htaccess

edit the "RewriteBase" in the htaccess_template file and rename it to .htaccess.
Onces this is done you can visit index.php and everything should be working.
